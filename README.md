## ⚠️ Important: Forked v-analyzer Required

This extension requires the **forked v-analyzer** — not the upstream version. The fork contains critical fixes and feature additions that are not in the official release.

### Why a Fork?

The upstream v-analyzer is missing some features/settings to align with this new enhanced Zed extension.

### Installing the Forked v-analyzer

Clone and build from source:

```sh
git clone --branch added-features --recursive https://github.com/DaZhi-the-Revelator/v-analyzer
cd v-analyzer
v run build.vsh release
```

The build script places the binary at `./bin/v-analyzer` (or `./bin/v-analyzer.exe` on Windows). Copy it to a location on your `PATH`, for example:

```sh
# Linux / macOS
cp bin/v-analyzer ~/.local/bin/v-analyzer

# Windows (PowerShell — run from the v-analyzer directory)
Copy-Item .\bin\v-analyzer.exe "$env:USERPROFILE\.config\v-analyzer\bin\v-analyzer.exe"
# Ensure that directory is on your PATH
```

**Verify:**

```sh
v-analyzer --version
# Should print: v-analyzer version 0.0.6
```

### Staying Up to Date

Pull the latest fixes and rebuild:

```sh
cd v-analyzer        # your clone of the fork
git pull
v run build.vsh
# then copy the binary to PATH as above
```

---

## Features

All LSP intelligence is provided by the forked v-analyzer. This extension wires every capability into Zed natively and adds the full Zed-specific layer on top.

---

### ✅ Core Language Intelligence

- **Diagnostics** — Real V compiler errors, warnings, and notices with:
  - `unused` variables and imports tagged with strikethrough (`DiagnosticTag.unnecessary`)
  - `deprecated` symbols tagged with strikethrough (`DiagnosticTag.deprecated`)
  - All errors, warnings, and notices from the actual V compiler — not heuristics

- **Type Checking** — Full PSI-based type inference:
  - Variable type inference across assignments
  - Cross-module type resolution
  - Generic type parameter tracking
  - Embedded struct type propagation

- **Go-to-Definition** — Navigate to any symbol's declaration:
  - User-defined functions, methods, structs, interfaces, enums, constants, variables
  - Cross-file and cross-module
  - Into the V standard library itself

- **Go-to-Type-Definition** — Jump to the *type* of a variable, not just where it was declared

- **Go-to-Implementation** — Bidirectional interface navigation:
  - From an interface → all structs that implement it
  - From a struct → all interfaces it satisfies
  - From an interface method → all concrete implementations

- **Hover Information** — Rich markdown documentation for every symbol type:
  - Functions and methods (signature + doc comment + module name)
  - **Structs** — renders the full struct body with fields grouped by access modifier (`pub mut`, `pub`, `mut`, private)
  - **Enums** — renders all fields with their computed values (implicit auto-increment, explicit values, and `[flag]` bitfield binary representations)
  - Type aliases and sum types (full `type A = B | C` signature)
  - Constants (with value and type)
  - Variables (with inferred type)
  - Parameters and receivers
  - Struct fields (with type and mutability)
  - Enum fields (with computed numeric value)
  - Import paths (with README content if available)
  - Generic parameters
  - Language keywords (e.g. `chan`)

---

### ✅ Advanced Code Editing

- **Intelligent Code Completion** — 19 context-aware providers including:
  - Struct fields after `.` (knows the type at the cursor)
  - Method completions after `.` on a typed variable
  - Module members after `.` on an import
  - All V keywords in the correct context
  - Attributes (`@[inline]`, `@[heap]`, `@[deprecated]`, etc.)
  - JSON field attribute names
  - `or` block expression completions
  - Loop keyword completions (`break`, `continue`)
  - Compile-time constants (`@FILE`, `@LINE`, `@MOD`, etc.)
  - Import path completions
  - Struct literal field completions
  - Return value completions based on function signature
  - `nil` and `none` in the correct contexts
  - Module name completions
  - Top-level declaration completions
- **Signature Help** — Real-time parameter hints as you type function calls:
  - Active parameter highlighted as you move through arguments
  - Retrigger support (`,` and ` ` re-trigger the hint)
  - Resolves the actual function declaration via PSI — always accurate
  - Works for all functions including stdlib and user-defined
- **Find All References** — PSI-based cross-file reference search:
  - Accurate — not text search, uses the program structure index
  - Works across modules and into the stdlib
  - Skips false positives in comments and strings automatically
- **Rename Symbol** (`F2`) — Safe, complete symbol renaming:
  - `prepareRename` validation before any changes are made
  - Finds every occurrence in the live open file using its in-memory parse tree — no stale positions
  - Correctly handles all reference types (declaration, usage, field access, method calls)
  - Works for: local variables, parameters, functions, methods, structs, enums, constants, type aliases
- **Document Formatting** — Via `v fmt`:
  - Always produces idiomatic, correctly indented V code
  - Handles the full V syntax including generics, attributes, and C interop
- **Folding Ranges** — Code folding for:
  - Function bodies
  - Struct, interface, and enum bodies
  - `if` / `else` blocks
  - `for` loops
  - `match` expressions
  - All `{ }` block constructs
- **Document Symbols** — Full nested symbol tree in the outline panel:
  - Functions and methods (with signature as detail)
  - Structs (with their fields nested inside)
  - Interfaces (with their methods and fields nested inside)
  - Enums (with their values nested inside, showing implicit values)
  - Constants (with type and value)
  - Type aliases
- **Inlay Hints** — 6 types of inline annotations:
  - **Type hints** — inferred type shown after `:=` assignments: `x: int := 10`
  - **Parameter name hints** — parameter names shown before arguments in function calls
  - **Range operator hints** — `≤` and `<` shown on `..` range operators to clarify inclusivity
  - **Implicit `err →` hints** — shown inside `or { }` blocks and `else` branches of result unwrapping
  - **Enum field value hints** — implicit enum field values shown inline next to each field
  - **Constant type hints** — type shown after constant declarations
- **Semantic Tokens** — Enhanced syntax highlighting from the LSP layer:
  - Two-pass system for accuracy and performance:
    - Fast syntax-based pass for files over 1000 lines
    - Accurate resolve-based pass for full semantic colouring on smaller files
  - Distinguishes user-defined functions from built-in functions
  - Correctly colours struct names, interface names, enum names vs. primitive types
  - Read vs. write access distinction for variable highlights
- **Workspace Symbols** — Global symbol search across your entire project:
  - Fully-qualified names (`module.Symbol`)
  - Searches all `.v` files via the persistent stub index
  - Fast — backed by the indexed stub cache, not a live file scan
- **Document Highlights** — All occurrences of the symbol under cursor:
  - **Read access** highlighted differently from **write access**
  - Declaration sites highlighted distinctly
  - Updates instantly as you move the cursor
- **Code Actions** — Compiler-integrated quick fixes and refactorings:
  - **Make Mutable** — adds `mut` to an immutable variable; triggered by `is immutable` compiler error
  - **Make Public** — adds `pub` to any declaration
  - **Add `[heap]` Attribute** — adds `[heap]` to a struct definition
  - **Add `[flag]` Attribute** — adds `[flag]` to an enum definition
  - **Import Module** — detects an `undefined ident` compiler error and automatically inserts the correct `import` statement

---

### ✅ Running Programs (Runnables)

V Enhanced wires Zed's Runnables system to the V compiler so you can run, build, and test without leaving the editor.

#### Gutter arrow (fn main)

When your cursor is inside or near `fn main()`, a ▶ arrow appears in the gutter. Clicking it (or using the Runnables panel) runs the file with `v run`. The dropdown also exposes build and test tasks.

#### `F4` — task picker

Press `F4` to open the full task list for the current file. Available tasks:

| Task | Command | When shown |
|------|---------|------------|
| `v run <file>` | `v run $ZED_FILE` | Any `.v` file |
| `v build <file>` | `v build $ZED_FILE` | Any `.v` file |
| `v test <file>` | `v test $ZED_FILE` | Any `.v` file |
| `v run <project>` | `v run $ZED_WORKTREE_ROOT` | When a worktree is open |
| `v build <project>` | `v build $ZED_WORKTREE_ROOT` | When a worktree is open |

All tasks run from the directory containing the source file (`$ZED_DIRNAME`) or the project root, as appropriate.

#### Test functions

Functions named `test_*` get their own gutter arrow and appear individually in the Runnables panel, each mapped to `v test $ZED_FILE`.

### ✅ Jupyter Kernel & REPL Integration

V Enhanced ships a complete Jupyter kernel (`v-kernel`) that integrates with Zed's built-in REPL.

#### Installing the Kernel

The kernel is in the `kernel/` subdirectory of this extension. It is a separate Rust project that must be built and installed independently.

**Requirements:**

- Rust (install from [rustup.rs](https://rustup.rs/))
- V compiler on your `PATH`
- Jupyter installed (`pip install jupyter` or via conda)
- On Linux/macOS: system ZeroMQ library

```bash
# macOS
brew install zeromq

# Ubuntu / Debian
sudo apt install libzmq3-dev

# Fedora / RHEL
sudo dnf install zeromq-devel
```

On Windows, ZeroMQ is bundled — no extra steps needed.

**Build and install:**

```bat
:: Windows
cd kernel
install.bat
```

```bash
# Linux / macOS
cd kernel
chmod +x install.sh
./install.sh
```

The install scripts build the kernel with `cargo build --release`, copy the binary to `~/.cargo/bin/`, and register the Jupyter kernelspec automatically.

**Verify:**

```sh
jupyter kernelspec list
# Should show:
#   v    /path/to/jupyter/kernels/v
```

#### Using the REPL in Zed

1. Open any `.v` file
2. Divide it into cells using `// %%` comment separators
3. Place your cursor in a cell
4. Press `Ctrl+Shift+Enter` (Windows/Linux) or `Cmd+Shift+Enter` (macOS) to execute the cell

If the V kernel doesn't appear in Zed's kernel picker, run **"REPL: Refresh Kernelspecs"** from the command palette (`Ctrl+Shift+P`).

#### How It Works

`v-kernel` implements the [Jupyter messaging protocol v5.3](https://jupyter-client.readthedocs.io/en/stable/messaging.html) over ZeroMQ.

**Stateful execution across cells:** top-level declarations (`fn`, `struct`, `enum`, `const`, `import`, `type`, `interface`) accumulate across cells for the duration of the session. Bare statements and expressions are automatically wrapped in `fn main()` and re-executed together with all accumulated declarations on each cell run. This mirrors how REPL kernels for other compiled languages (e.g. `evcxr` for Rust) work.

```v
import math

// %%

// Cell 1 — declarations accumulate across cells
struct Point {
    x f64
    y f64
}

fn distance(a Point, b Point) f64 {
    return math.sqrt((b.x - a.x) * (b.x - a.x) + (b.y - a.y) * (b.y - a.y))
}

// %%

// Cell 2 — statements run inside fn main() automatically
p1 := Point{0, 0}
p2 := Point{3, 4}
println(distance(p1, p2))  // → 5.0

// %%

// Cell 3 — prior declarations are still in scope
p3 := Point{6, 8}
println(distance(p1, p3))  // → 10.0
```

#### Kernel Architecture

| Component | Purpose |
|-----------|---------|
| ZeroMQ sockets | Jupyter wire transport (shell, iopub, stdin, control, heartbeat) |
| HMAC-SHA256 | Message signing per the Jupyter protocol |
| Session state | Accumulated declarations tracked across cell executions |
| V compiler | Each cell invokes `v run` on the assembled program |

#### Kernel Limitations

- **No autocomplete in notebooks** — completion comes from v-analyzer via LSP, not the kernel; works in `.v` files, not in `.ipynb` notebooks
- **Recompilation on every cell** — the full accumulated program is recompiled each time; V is fast, but long sessions accumulate more code to compile
- **No interrupt** — `Ctrl+C` sends `interrupt_request` but the kernel does not yet forward SIGINT to the running `v` process
- **Plain text output only** — no rich display (images, HTML, etc.); V has no equivalent of IPython's `display()` machinery

---

### ✅ Syntax Highlighting

Powered by `tree_sitter_v` — v-analyzer's own battle-tested grammar — with comprehensive Zed-specific highlight queries covering:

- Functions, methods, and function calls (distinguished)
- Struct, interface, enum, and type declarations
- All keyword categories: storage modifiers (`mut`, `pub`, `const`, `static`), control flow (`if`, `for`, `match`, `return`), type definitions (`struct`, `interface`, `enum`, `type`)
- String literals: interpreted, raw, C strings, string interpolation
- Escape sequences within strings
- Rune literals
- Integer and float literals
- Boolean literals (`true`, `false`)
- Builtin constants (`nil`, `none`)
- Attributes (`@[...]`)
- Modules and import paths
- Struct fields and selector expressions
- Enum fetch expressions (`Direction.north`)
- Global variable definitions
- Compile-time constructs (`$if`, `$for`, `$else`)
- Labels
- All operators (arithmetic, bitwise, comparison, assignment, channel, range)
- Comments: line (`//`) and block (`/* */`)
- Shebang (`#!/usr/bin/env v`)

---

### ✅ Rainbow Brackets (Optional)

Color-coded nesting levels for `{}`, `[]`, and `()`.

Enable in your Zed `settings.json`:

```json
{
  "languages": {
    "V": {
      "colorize_brackets": true
    }
  }
}
```

Or enable globally:

```json
{
  "colorize_brackets": true
}
```

---

### ✅ Feature Toggles

All v-analyzer features can be individually enabled or disabled via your Zed `settings.json`. Changes take effect after a full Zed restart.

```json
"lsp": {
  "v-analyzer": {
    "initialization_options": {
      "inlay_hints": {
        "enable": true,
        "enable_type_hints": true,
        "enable_parameter_name_hints": true,
        "enable_range_hints": true,
        "enable_implicit_err_hints": true,
        "enable_constant_type_hints": true,
        "enable_enum_field_value_hints": true
      },
      "enable_semantic_tokens": "full"
    }
  }
}
```

**`enable_semantic_tokens` values:**

| Value | Behaviour |
|-------|-----------|
| `"full"` | Two-pass: accurate semantic + syntax highlighting (default) |
| `"syntax"` | Syntax-only pass — faster, recommended for very large files |
| `"none"` | Semantic tokens disabled entirely |

---

## Requirements

### Forked v-analyzer (Required)

See the [Installing the Forked v-analyzer](#installing-the-forked-v-analyzer) section above.

> **Do not use the upstream v-analyzer.** It will crash on enum hover and produce incorrect rename results.

### V Compiler

v-analyzer uses the V compiler for diagnostics and formatting. Install V from [vlang.io](https://vlang.io/).

If v-analyzer cannot find your V installation automatically, create a project-local config:

```sh
v-analyzer init
```

Then set `custom_vroot` in the generated `.v-analyzer/config.toml`.

### Jupyter Kernel (Optional)

Required only if you want REPL/notebook support. See [Jupyter Kernel & REPL Integration](#-jupyter-kernel--repl-integration) above.

---

## Installation

### ~~From Zed Extensions Marketplace~~

1. ~~Open Zed~~
2. ~~Go to Extensions (`Ctrl+Shift+X` / `Cmd+Shift+X`)~~
3. ~~Search for **V Enhanced**~~
4. ~~Click Install~~
5. ~~Install the forked v-analyzer (see above)~~

### Development Installation

1. Clone this repository
2. Build the extension:

   ```bat
   :: Windows
   build.bat
   ```

   ```sh
   # Linux / macOS
   chmod +x build.sh && ./build.sh
   ```

3. In Zed, open Extensions (`Ctrl+Shift+X`)
4. Click **Install Dev Extension**
5. Select this folder
6. Install the forked v-analyzer (see above)

---

## Configuration

### Per-Project v-analyzer Config

Create a local config at your project root for project-specific settings:

```sh
v-analyzer init
```

This creates `.v-analyzer/config.toml`. Key settings:

```toml
# Path to your V installation (if v-analyzer can't find it automatically)
custom_vroot = "/path/to/v"

# Custom cache directory
custom_cache_dir = ".v-analyzer/cache"

# Semantic tokens mode: "full", "syntax", or "none"
enable_semantic_tokens = "full"

[inlay_hints]
enable = true
enable_type_hints = true
enable_parameter_name_hints = true
enable_range_hints = true
enable_implicit_err_hints = true
enable_constant_type_hints = true
enable_enum_field_value_hints = true
```

A global config also exists at `~/.config/v-analyzer/config.toml` and applies to all projects.

## Troubleshooting

### v-analyzer not found

- Confirm it is in your PATH: `where v-analyzer` (Windows) / `which v-analyzer` (Linux/Mac)
- Make sure you are using **the fork**, not the upstream version
- Build and install from: `https://github.com/DaZhi-the-Revelator/v-analyzer`
- Restart Zed after installing

### Server crashes on enum hover

- You are using the upstream v-analyzer — install the fork (see above)

### Rename only updates one occurrence

- You are using the upstream v-analyzer — install the fork (see above)

### No diagnostics / formatting not working

- v-analyzer needs the V compiler: confirm `v` is in PATH or set `custom_vroot` in config
- Run `v-analyzer init` in your project root and set `custom_vroot` in the generated config

### Indexing is slow on first open

- v-analyzer indexes your workspace and the V stdlib on first use — this is normal
- Progress is shown in the Zed status bar
- Subsequent opens use the cached index and are fast

### Jupyter kernel not appearing in Zed

- Run `jupyter kernelspec list` to confirm the kernel is installed
- If missing, re-run `install.bat` / `install.sh` from the `kernel/` directory
- Run **"REPL: Refresh Kernelspecs"** from the Zed command palette (`Ctrl+Shift+P`)
- Make sure `jupyter` is installed and on your PATH

### Build script says "Cargo.toml or src\lib.rs has error" / WASM file not produced

This message can appear even when the Rust compilation actually succeeded, if the `rustup target list` check in an older version of the script produced a false negative. The real cause is usually that the WASM copy step was never reached.

**Fix:** Run the build command directly, then copy the output manually:

```bat
:: Windows
cargo build --release --target wasm32-wasip1
copy /Y target\wasm32-wasip1\release\zed_v_enhanced.wasm extension.wasm
```

```sh
# Linux / macOS
cargo build --release --target wasm32-wasip1
cp target/wasm32-wasip1/release/zed_v_enhanced.wasm extension.wasm
```

If `rustup target add wasm32-wasip1` reports *"component 'Rust-std' for target 'wasm32-wasip1' is up to date"*, the target is already installed — the script was just detecting it incorrectly. The updated `build.bat` / `build.sh` use an idempotent `rustup target add` call instead of fragile string matching, so this is fixed in the current scripts.

### Features stopped working after a Zed update

- Rebuild the extension with `build.bat` / `build.sh` and reinstall

### Settings don't seem to apply

- Settings changes require a **full Zed restart** — not just closing and reopening a file

### Checking logs

- Zed menu → View → Zed Log
- Look for `v-analyzer` entries to see initialization and request details
